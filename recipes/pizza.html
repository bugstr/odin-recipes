    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>This simple brick-oven pizza recipe has been made famous by several well-known, Brooklyn wood-fire pizzerias. Best accompanied by ice-cold, pilsner-style lager beer.</p>
    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <p><u1>
        <li>warm water</li>
        <li>active dry yeast</li>
        <li>cold water</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>bread flour</li>
        <li>extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>basil</li>
    </u1></p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl, then sprinkle yeast over the top. Let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in cold water and salt. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth, about 10 minutes. Divide in half and form into two tight dough balls. Coat with olive oil and refrigerate in a sealed container for at least 16 hours. Be sure to use a big enough container to allow dough to rise.</li>
        <li>Make the pizzas: Remove dough from the refrigerator one hour prior to using.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven, with a pizza stone on the lowest rack, to 550 degrees F (288 degrees C). Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour.</li>
        <li>Prepare the first pizza: Lightly dust one dough ball with flour and stretch gradually until about 14 inches in diameter, or about the size of the pizza stone. Place on the floured peel.</li>
    </ol>
