    <ul>
        <li class="li fonts">1 large russet potato</li>
        <li class="li fonts">2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li class="li fonts">salt</li>
    </ul>
     <div class ="heading2 fonts">Steps</div>
    <ol>
        <li class="li fonts">Soak potato strips in a large bowl of water for about 30 minutes. Pat with paper towels until thoroughly dry.</li>
        <li class="li fonts">Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Gently add potatoes to the hot oil and fry for about 5 minutes, stirring and flipping the potatoes occasionally. Use a slotted spoon to transfer potatoes to a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool completely.</li>
        <li class="li fonts">Heat oil again, but this time to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Add potatoes and fry a second time until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li class="li fonts">Remove from the deep-fryer and blot with a paper towel. Sprinkle with salt to serve.</li>
    </ol>
