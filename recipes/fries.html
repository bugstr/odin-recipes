        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Gently add potatoes to the hot oil and fry for about 5 minutes, stirring and flipping the potatoes occasionally. Use a slotted spoon to transfer potatoes to a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool completely.</li>
        <li>Heat oil again, but this time to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Add potatoes and fry a second time until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the deep-fryer and blot with a paper towel. Sprinkle with salt to serve.</li>
